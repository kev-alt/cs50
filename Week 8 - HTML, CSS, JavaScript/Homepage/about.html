    <p> Hey there! I’m Kevser! A final-year Computer Engineering student in Istanbul, exploring the magic of technology and coding like a digital wizard. I’m passionate about Artificial Intelligence, Natural Language Processing (NLP), and Speech Recognition. My dream? To develop an app that understands human emotions and supports mental well-being—because tech isn’t just about code, it’s about heart too! 💙

        Even though I love diving into the software world, I’m not just a coding robot. I stay active with fitness and pilates, immerse myself in music, and sometimes disappear into the gaming universe. Need a partner for an epic game night? Count me in! 🎮

        When I travel, you’ll find a book in my bag, my favorite playlist in my ears, and a crazy new project idea in my head. Creating a blockchain revolution? Why not! 🚀

        If you're looking for me, I’m probably coding with a cup of coffee, reading something fascinating, or dreaming up the next big tech innovation. Who knows? Maybe one day, I’ll come up with an idea that changes the world!
